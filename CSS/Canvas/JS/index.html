Overloading method : <br>
There are two diffent copies of the constructor or methods that take different numbers and types of arguments. <br>
Why Use? think of diffent slightly versions of maps on the website. 
Return type is NOT part of the method signature.
Overloaded methods can have different return types. 
Changing the return type is NOT enough for overloading
At compile time, Java C, the compiler, has to decide which version of the overloaded method you're actually trying to call. 
And it does that by using the parameter list. It can't do it by using return type alone. 

Public and Private : <br>
Having the getter and setter allows us more control as class designers. So let's say we want to allow the user to change the value of the latitude. We're not sure if the user uses the member variable properly. So maybe we can put some condition to ensure to use the proper number or value. Otherwise it can return the error. 

Draw Memory Models for reasoning about variable values for primitive type and update memory models to trade the state of the variables. 

8 types of primitive types : boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, char/
Everything else is object.

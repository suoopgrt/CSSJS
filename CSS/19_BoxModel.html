	<div id="content">Chris was an extraordinary man who deeply loved and respected his profession with great old fashion manners, self deprecating humor and the music of words, said Lou Pitt, his longtime friend and manager of 46 years. He was a national treasure who deeply relished his Canadian roots. Through his art and humanity, he touched all of our hearts and his legendary life will endure for all generations to come. He will forever be with us.</div>

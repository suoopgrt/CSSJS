	<h3>JSON</h3>
	 JavaScript Object Notation<br>
	 JSON is a format that is used pretty widely, especially when we speak about passing data between the server and the client. <br>
	 It is a lightweight data interchange format. It is simple textual representation of data. <br>
	 1. Easy for humans to read and write <br>
	 2. Easy for machines to parse and generate <br>
	 Subset of Javascript object literal syntax ... but <br>
	 (1) Property names must be in double quotes <br>
	 (2) String values must be in double quotes <br>
	 Syntax for everything else is exactly like for object literal<br>
	 - JSON is Not a Javascript Object Literal <br>
	 - JSON is just a string <br>
	 - The Syntax of JSON is based on objet literal though <br>
	 - Need to convert JSON into a JS object <br>
	 convert from json string to object 
	 var obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);<br>
	 convert from object to json string 
	 var str = JSON.stringify(obj); <br>
	 We can use herokuapp using Ruby on Rails app. <br>
